          A video game[a] or computer game is an electronic game that involves
          interaction with a user interface or input device – such as a
          joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device – to generate
          visual feedback. This feedback mostly commonly is shown on a video
          display device, such as a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual
          reality headset. Some computer games do not always depend on a
          graphics display, for example text adventure games and computer chess
          can be played through teletype printers. Video games are often
          augmented with audio feedback delivered through speakers or
          headphones, and sometimes with other types of feedback, including
          haptic technology. Video games are defined based on their platform,
          which include arcade video games, console games, and personal computer
          (PC) games. More recently, the industry has expanded onto mobile
          gaming through smartphones and tablet computers, virtual and augmented
          reality systems, and remote cloud gaming.
